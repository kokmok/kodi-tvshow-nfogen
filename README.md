# kodi-tvshow-nfogen
A kodi addon to easily add tvshows to library.
This was made to let family to create basic but correct nfo files to be sure kodi will find tvshow and add it to library. 

## install
download zip here and install from zip, or clone the repo in the kodi's addon directry, restart kodi, go to "My addons" and enable "nfogen"

### How it works
1. don't mess your files. The filesystem works well like that :
-  tvshows (video source directory)
   - tvshow S[seasonNum]
     -  episodefile (you have to ensure the episode number is in the name (ex: Yakari.E01.mkv ) (also works with Yakari.1.[otherInfo.]mkv)
2. Open addon
3. Go to the tvshow season directory click ok
4. Write the show name (give attention to well name your show)
5. Give the season number (two digits is better)
6. Select an image to be the show thumb
7. confirm
8. update library


This is my very first python script and very first kodi addon. Feel free to help to make it better.
